Hello, my name is Miao Jiawei, a 24-year-old boy from Nantong, Jiangsu Province. I graduated from Soochow University last year, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. Then I joined Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Company as a software engineer. I use Springboot as the back end in my work, and use basic skills in the front end, such as HTML, CSS ï¼ŒJS and jQuery.I want to join OCBC to improve my technical level and a better working environment.
